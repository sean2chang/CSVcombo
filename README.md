<h1>Combine CSV Files</h1>
<h4>Created by: Sean Chang</h4>

<p>Welcome! I created a single Python script where it combines multiple CSV files together into a single file. I welcome any input or suggestions as this script is intended to help others with menial tasks such as combining files with multiple months together.</p>

<p>As you can see, the repository contains multiple CSV files with data for individual NBA players for each season. The files are only used as a sample and are not required for the script to work.</p>

<p>The repository also contains a single Python script, combine.py. You must input this script in the same directory as the files you are combining together. The output of the new file will also be created in this same directory.</p>.
